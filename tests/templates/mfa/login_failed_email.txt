Dear {{ user.username }},

We detected an attempt to log in to your account on {{ site_name }}
({{ domain }}) using a wrong two-factor authentication code. This means someone
managed to enter the correct password, but failed at {{ method }}.

If this was you and you entered a wrong two-factor authentication code by
accident, you may ignore this email.

If this was not you, we strongly recommend to change your password.
